# Storybook Coverage

All UI components with loading, error, or transitional states **must** have Storybook stories representing each state. This makes states easy to polish, iterate on, and visually verify without needing to reproduce them in the running app. Examples: artwork sync phases (hashing, querying, downloading, done, error, not-found), empty/loading library, form validation errors.
