# GameLord

## Key Documentation

- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` — Architecture overview, completed work, TODO roadmap, and technical notes. Read this first when orienting on the project.

## Git Conventions

- Use descriptive branch names: `<type>/<short-descriptive-name>`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
- Examples: `feat/game-library-search`, `fix/storybook-tailwind`, `refactor/emulator-manager`

## Design Philosophy

- **Extremely polished UI.** Every interaction should feel intentional and delightful. Prioritize craft and attention to detail — this is a desktop app, not a throwaway prototype.
- **Microinteractions and animations.** Use tasteful transitions, hover effects, loading states, and motion to make the app feel alive. Think about easing curves, staggered animations, and subtle feedback on every click, toggle, and navigation.
- **Ideate novel flourishes.** When implementing a feature, proactively suggest creative UI touches — e.g. a CRT power-on animation when launching a game, particle effects on achievements, satisfying haptic-style feedback on button presses, ambient glow effects. Propose these ideas to the user before implementing.
