# Hoist @radix-ui packages to the root node_modules so that Vite/Rollup
# can resolve transitive dependencies when bundling workspace packages.
# Without this, pnpm's strict isolation nests @radix-ui packages under
# packages/ui/node_modules/, and Rollup (following the symlink path from
# apps/desktop/node_modules/@gamelord/ui/) can't walk up to the root to
# find sibling @radix-ui packages.
